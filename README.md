# To-do-List

The To-Do List is a web application that allows users to organize their tasks efficiently. Users can add, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, they can create and manage
multiple to-do lists, each with its own set of tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add tasks to their to-do list, specifying the task name and any additional details.

- **Delete Tasks:** Completed tasks can be deleted from the list, helping users keep their to-do list clutter-free.

- **Create Lists:** Users can create multiple to-do lists, each with its own title, allowing for better organization of tasks.

- **Delete Lists:** Users can delete entire to-do lists when they are no longer needed.

- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks and lists are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring that the user's data is preserved across sessions.
